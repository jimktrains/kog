# Kog

This language is designed to aid in the programming of Real-Time systems, specifically memory-constrained microcontrollers.

My goals are to make it strongly types, easy to use and verify, as well as supporting a decent object system.

See [small.kog](small.kog) for an idea of what I want it to become.  parser.py is slightly out of date and won't currently parse small.kog
